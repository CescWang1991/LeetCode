  * Closure Numberï¼š
  *
  * To enumerate something, generally we would like to express it as a sum of disjoint subsets that are easier to count.
  * Consider the closure number of a valid parentheses sequence S: the least index >= 0 so that S[0], S[1], ...,
  * S[2*index+1] is valid.
  *
  * For each closure number c, we know the starting and ending brackets must be at index 0 and 2*c + 1. Then, the 2*c
  * elements between must be a valid sequence, plus the rest of the elements must be a valid sequence.
